This is my CS50 final project, the Animal Crossing Fish Tracker.

In the popular new video game, Animal Crossing New Horizons, players move to a deserted island. They must explore, craft, and collect resources to improve the island.

One aspect of this is fishing. There are 80 species of fish in the game, but not all fish are available at all times. This can be frustrating when you don't know where to spend your time fishing to catch the most valuable, or rarest, fish.

That is why I created the Animal Crossing Fish Tracker. This website allows you to filter a table containing all the game's fish by:
 - Current Month
 - Location
 - Current Time
 
This information allows you to make better use of your time spent in the game and help you get one step closer to that elusive fish you've been trying to catch.
